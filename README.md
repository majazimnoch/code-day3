# A stopwatch written in JavaScript

## Intro
This is the third project of my 30-day coding challenge. The project includes following tech stuff: html, css, JavaScript.

## Idea
The goal was to make an stopwatch where a user can pause and reset the timer.

## Breaking down the code
This JavaScript code sets up a simple timer functionality with start, pause, and reset buttons. It utilizes a combination of event listeners and functions to handle the timer logic. The timer's state is tracked through variables like paused, and the elapsed time is calculated using the Date.now() function. The updateTime function formats the elapsed time into hours, minutes, and seconds, ensuring that each unit is displayed with leading zeros if necessary. Additionally, there's a helper function pad to ensure the proper formatting of single-digit time units.
